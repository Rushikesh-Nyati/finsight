# FinSight Personal Finance App - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview
FinSight is a privacy-first personal finance application that automatically categorizes SMS transactions using on-device machine learning. The app provides budget planning, spending forecasts, and savings recommendations while keeping all sensitive data on the user's device.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Frontend (Flutter)
- **Framework**: Flutter with Dart
- **State Management**: Provider pattern
- **Database**: SQLite (sqflite) for local storage
- **ML Integration**: TensorFlow Lite for on-device inference
- **Charts**: fl_chart for data visualization
- **HTTP**: http package for API communication

### Backend (Python/Flask)
- **Framework**: Flask with CORS support
- **Data Processing**: Pandas and NumPy
- **Database**: SQLite for backend data persistence
- **Analytics**: Simple statistical models for budget and forecasting

## 📱 Features Implemented

### 1. Onboarding Flow
- ✅ Welcome screen with app benefits
- ✅ SMS permission request with privacy explanation
- ✅ Initial SMS analysis and categorization

### 2. SMS Processing & ML
- ✅ Robust regex-based SMS parser
- ✅ TensorFlow Lite model integration (with fallback)
- ✅ Transaction categorization (10 predefined categories)
- ✅ Uncategorized transaction handling

### 3. Main Dashboard
- ✅ Monthly spending summary card
- ✅ Category-wise spending pie chart
- ✅ Recent transactions list
- ✅ Quick action buttons for all features

### 4. Manual Expense Entry
- ✅ Form with amount, merchant, category, date
- ✅ Category dropdown with icons
- ✅ Date picker integration
- ✅ Form validation

### 5. Budget Planning
- ✅ AI-powered budget suggestions
- ✅ Budget vs spending comparison chart
- ✅ Category-wise budget tracking
- ✅ Progress indicators

### 6. Spending Forecast
- ✅ 30-day spending predictions
- ✅ Trend analysis with line charts
- ✅ Daily forecast breakdown
- ✅ Statistical forecasting algorithm

### 7. Savings Planner
- ✅ Goal-based savings planning
- ✅ Discretionary vs essential spending analysis
- ✅ Spending cut suggestions
- ✅ Timeline optimization

## 🔒 Privacy & Security Features

- **On-Device Processing**: All SMS analysis happens locally
- **No Data Transmission**: Sensitive SMS data never leaves the device
- **Local Storage**: All transaction data stored in device SQLite database
- **ML Privacy**: TensorFlow Lite model runs entirely on-device
- **Aggregated Analytics**: Backend only receives anonymized spending patterns

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Data Models
- `Transaction`: Core transaction data structure
- `Category`: Predefined spending categories with icons and colors
- `BudgetSuggestion`, `ForecastData`, `SavingsPlan`: API response models

### Services
- `DatabaseService`: SQLite operations and queries
- `SMSParserService`: SMS parsing and financial message detection
- `SMSMLService`: ML model integration and categorization
- `ApiService`: Backend API communication

### State Management
- `TransactionProvider`: Centralized transaction state management
- Provider pattern for reactive UI updates

## 🌐 API Endpoints

### POST /initial-budget
Generates budget suggestions based on historical spending data with 10% buffer.

### POST /forecast
Creates 30-day spending forecasts using statistical analysis.

### POST /savings-plan
Generates savings plans with spending cut recommendations.

### GET /health
Health check endpoint for monitoring.

## 📊 Data Flow

1. **SMS Processing**: Parse financial SMS → Extract transaction data → ML categorization
2. **Local Storage**: Store categorized transactions in SQLite
3. **Analytics**: Aggregate spending data → Send to backend → Receive insights
4. **UI Updates**: Provider notifies widgets → Reactive UI updates

## 🚀 Getting Started

cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### Testing
```bash
cd backend
python test_api.py
```
