# Placeholder TensorFlow Lite model file
# In a real implementation, this would be a trained .tflite model
# For development purposes, this is just a placeholder

# This file represents the sms_categorizer.tflite model that would be:
# 1. Trained on SMS transaction data
# 2. Optimized for mobile inference
# 3. Capable of categorizing financial transactions

# The model would typically:
# - Take merchant names and transaction descriptions as input
# - Output category probabilities
# - Be small enough to run efficiently on mobile devices
# - Provide privacy by running entirely on-device

# For this MVP, the app will use rule-based categorization as a fallback
# when the model cannot be loaded or fails to provide confident predictions.
